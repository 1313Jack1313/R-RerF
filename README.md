# R-RerF
## This is the R implementation of Randomer Forest([RerF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.03410v2.pdf "arxiv link to RerF paper"))


## Features of R-Rerf:
- [x] Train a forest on a given dataset
- [x] Determine Error Rate of Forest
- [x] Make Predictions
- [x] Bagging
- [x] Out-Of-Bag Error Estimation
- [x] Max Depth Limit
- [x] Rotation matrix as parameter

## Use:
###   To create a forest:
   1. Download rfr_function.R
   2. In R --> ```source('path/to/file/rfr_function.R')```  
   3. In R --> ```forest <- rfr(X, Y, MinParent=6, trees=100, MaxDepth=0, bagging = .20, FUN=makeA, options=ncol(X))```  
  - **forest** --> the trained forest structure is used as input in the error_rate and predict functions.
  - **X** --> an n by d dataset where the rows are the n samples and the columns are the p features.
  - **Y** --> a vector of n class labels.  Labels must start at 1 and rise sequentially (e.g. if you have three classes then the first one is '1', then second one is '2', and the third one is '3'.
  - **MinParent** --> an integer greater than 1.  This defines the minimum node size.  Any node with MinParent elements will not have a child node.  The default value is 6 (MinParent=6).
  - **Trees** --> an integer greater than 0.  This is the number of trees that will be in the forest.  The default value is 100 (trees=100).
  - **MaxDepth** --> is the maximum depth that a tree can grow to.  If set to "inf" then there is no maximum depth.  If set to 0 then a maximum depth is calculated based on the number of classes and number of samples provided.
  - **bagging** --> is the percentage of training data to withhold during each training iteration.  If set to 0 then the entire training set is used during every iteration.  The withheld portion of the training data  is used to calculate OOB error for the tree.
  - **FUN** --> is the function used to create the rotation matrix.  The matrix returned by this function should be a p-by-u matrix where p is the number of columns in the input matrix X and u is any integer > 0.  u can also vary from node to node.
  - **options** --> is a list of inputs to the user provided rotation matrix creation function -- FUN.  Option is set to ncol(X) by default.

###   To determine the error rate of a forest:
   1. Download rfr_function.R
   2. In R --> ```source('path/to/file/rfr_function.R')```
   3. In R --> ```Error_Rate <- error_rate(X,Y,Forest)```
  - **X** --> an n by d dataset where the rows are the n samples and the columns are the p features.
  - **Y** --> a vector of n class labels.  Labels must start at 1 and rise sequentially (e.g. if you have three classes then the first one is '1', then second one is '2', and the third one is '3'.
  - **Forest** --> This is a type created by the rfr training function.

###   To make a prediction on data:
   1. Download rfr_function.R
   2. In R --> ```source('path/to/file/rfr_function.R')```
   3. In R --> ```Predictions <- predict(X,Forest)```
  - **X** --> an n by d dataset where the rows are the n samples and the columns are the p features.
  - **Forest** --> This is a type created by the rfr training function.

## Example using iris data set:
```R
X <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])  
Y <- as.numeric(iris[,5])  
# basic use of forest generator
forest <- rfr(X,Y)  
error_rate(X,Y,forest)  
predict(X,forest)

# basic use of function creation
ID <- function(options){
diag(options)}

forest2 <- rfr(X,Y,FUN=ID)
error_rate(X,Y,forest2)
predict(X,forest2)

# advanced use of forest generator
IDscale <- function(options){
size <- options[1]
scale <- options[2]
diag(size)*scale}

forest3 <- rfr(X, Y, MinParent=10, trees=1000, MaxDepth=6, bagging = .10, FUN=IDscale, options=c(nrow(X), .5)){
error_rate(X,Y,forest3)
predict(X,forest3)
```
Additional examples can be found in the .rmd files located in the "versions" directory

## Default rotation matrix creation:
This is the function that rfr uses by default to create a rotation matrix.
```R
makeA <- function(options){
 p <- options
 mtry <- ceiling(log2(p))
 # Create the A matrix, a sparse matrix of 1's, -1's, and 0's.
 sparseM <- matrix(0,nrow=p,ncol=mtry)
 sparseM[sample(1:(p*mtry),mtry,replace=F)] <- 1
 sparseM[sample(1:(p*mtry),mtry,replace=F)] <- -1
 #The below returns a matrix after removing all columns that only contain zeroes.
 sparseM <- as.matrix(sparseM[,!apply(sparseM==0,2,all)])
}
```
