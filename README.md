## Description:
Randomer Forest (RerF) is a generalization of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. RF partitions the input (feature) space via a series of recursive binary hyperplanes. Hyperplanes are constrained to be axis-aligned. In other words, each partition is a test of the form X<sub>i</sub> > t, where t is a threshold and X<sub>i</sub> is one of p inputs (features) {X<sub>1</sub>, ..., X<sub>p</sub>}. The best axis-aligned split is found by sampling a random subset of the p inputs and choosing the one that best partitions the observed data according to some specified split criterion. RerF relaxes the constraint that the splitting hyperplanes must be axis-aligned. That is, each partition in RerF is a test of the form w<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + ... + w<sub>p</sub>X<sub>p</sub> > t. The orientations of hyperplanes are sampled randomly via a user-specified distribution on the coefficients w<sub>i</sub>, although an empirically validated default distribution is provided. Currently only classification is supported. Regression and unsupervised learning will be supported in the future.

## Installation:
- Non-Windows users install the GNU Scientific Library (libgsl0-dev).
- Windows users install Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

### via CRAN
From within R-

```install.packages("rerf")```

### via devtools
Install dev-tools if not currently installed. From within R-  

```install.packages("devtools")```

Install R-RerF from github.  From within R-  

```devtools::install_github("neurodata/R-Rerf")```

## Use:
###   Load the library :
```library(rerf)```

###   To create a forest:
To create a forest the minimum data needed is an n by d sample matrix (x) and an n length vector of corresponding classes (y).  Each row of x is a sample and each column of x is a feature.  

```forest <- RerF(x,y)```  
  
"forest" is a trained forest which is needed for all other rerf functions.  Additional parameters and more complex examples of training a forest can be found using the help function (```?RerF```)

###   Making predictions and determining error rate:
In the example below, trainIdx is used to subset the iris dataset in order to make a training set and a testing set.
```
trainIdx <- c(1:40, 51:90, 101:140)
X <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
Y <- as.numeric(iris[,5])
forest <- RerF(X[trainIdx, ], Y[trainIdx], num.cores = 1L, rank.transform = TRUE)
# Using a set of samples with unknown classification
predictions <- Predict(X[-trainIdx, ], forest, num.cores = 1L, Xtrain = X[trainIdx, ])
error.rate <- mean(predictions != Y[-trainIdx])
```

If a testing set is not available the error rate of a forest can be determined based on the samples held out-of-bag while training (out-of-bag samples are randomly chosen for each tree in the forest).
```
X <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
Y <- iris[[5L]]
forest <- RerF(X, Y, store.oob=TRUE, num.cores = 1L)
predictions <- OOBPredict(X, forest, num.cores = 1L)
oob.error <- mean(predictions != Y)
```  
  
###   Compute similarities:
Computes pairwise similarities between observations. The similarity between two points is defined as the fraction of trees such that two points fall into the same leaf node (i.e. two samples are similar if they consistently show up in the same leaf node).  This function produces an n by n symmetric similarity matrix.  
```  
X <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
Y <- iris[[5L]]
forest <- RerF(X, Y, num.cores = 1L)
sim.matrix <- ComputeSimilarity(X, forest, num.cores = 1L)
```  
  
###   Compute tree strengths and correlations:
Computes estimates of tree strength and correlation according to the definitions in Breiman's 2001 Random Forests paper.  
```
trainIdx <- c(1:40, 51:90, 101:140)
X <- as.matrix(iris[,1:4])
Y <- iris[[5]]
forest <- RerF(X[trainIdx, ], Y[trainIdx], num.cores = 1L)
predictions <- Predict(X[-trainIdx, ], forest, num.cores = 1L, aggregate.output =     FALSE)
scor <- StrCorr(predictions, Y[-trainIdx])
```

###   Compute feature (projection) importance:
Computes the Gini importance for all of the unique projections used to split the data. The returned value is a list with members imp and proj. The member imp is a numeric vector of feature importances sorted in decreasing order. The member proj is a list the same length as imp of vectors specifying the split projections corresponding to the values in imp. The projections are represented by the vector such that the odd numbered indices indicate the canonical feature indices and the even numbered indices indicate the linear coefficients. For example a vector (1,-1,4,1,5,-1) is the projection -X1 + X4 - X5. **Note**: it is highly advised to run this only when the splitting features (projections) have unweighted coefficients, such as for the default setting or for RF.
```
X <- as.matrix(iris[, 1:4]) # feature matrix
Y <- iris$Species # class labels
p <- ncol(X) # number of features in the data
d <- ceiling(sqrt(p)) # number of features to sample at each split

# Here we specify that we want to run the standard random forest algorithm and we want to store the decrease in impurity at each split node. The latter option is required in order to compute Gini feature importance.

forest <- RerF(as.matrix(iris[, 1:4]), iris[[5L]], mat.options = list(p, d, "rf", NULL), num.cores = 1L, store.impurity = TRUE)
feature.imp <- FeatureImportance(forest, num.cores = 1L)
```
