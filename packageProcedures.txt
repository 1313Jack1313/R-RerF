1.  Create Documentation: until the package is 100% ready we have to manually create the documentation.  This is a trivial step, but must be done to update the man files.
    library(devtools)
    devtools::check("path/to/package")

    This will create the man files from the roxygen metadata at the beginning of each file.
    This will not change the NAMESPACE file which also must be modified.

    It will also check to see if the package has any problems.

    Current problems include: packages names should not be stated as requireNamespace(whatever) from within a function.  <<- is apparently not allowed in functions.  And the examples don't work, which they can't work because you have to provide a forest.  Will find how to not test examples.


2.  Check functionality:
    library(utils)
    remove.packages("rerf")
    install("rerf")

    or from bash
    R CMD INSTALL rerf
